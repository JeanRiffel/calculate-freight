<h2> Steps </h2>

- Place a Order    
- Adding products to a Order
- Calculate the freight of the Order

    - We can only calculate a freight when the product is inside a order.
    - Each product has a weight, height, length and width.
    - We need to decide between the volume or weight
    


<h2> Instructions </h2>
    
    npm install

    Whether you do not have the nvm install on your computer I recommend to install it or check the .nvmrc to find out which version of node the app is using.

       - on dev mode:  npm run start:dev
       - on test mode: npm run test
